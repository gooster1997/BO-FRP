# Datasets of the MC simulation results of different FRP scenarios
This repository contains the Monte Carlo simulation results of four different polymerization methods optimized by Bayesian optimization. The filenames with "photo" or "therm" correspond to photo-initiated or thermally-initiated polymerization, while "disp" or "coup" correspond to disproportionation termination and coupling termination.

Each CSV file contains the simulation results of the recommended reaction parameters for each iteration of the Bayesian optimization cycle. Each row in the file represents a simulation, where the first 13 columns represent the input reaction parameters, and the last 3 columns represent the simulated molecular weight distribution, molecular weight, and total monomer conversion, respectively. The 13 reaction parameters are listed in the following order: log(*k*<sub>i</sub>), log(*k*<sub>paa</sub>), log(*k*<sub>pbb</sub>), log(*k*<sub>1</sub>), log(*k*<sub>2</sub>), log(*k*<sub>taa</sub>/*k*<sub>paa</sub>), log(*k*<sub>tbb</sub>/*k*<sub>pbb</sub>), log(*k*<sub>traa</sub>/*k*<sub>paa</sub>), log(*k*<sub>trab</sub>/*k*<sub>pab</sub>), log(*k*<sub>trba</sub>/*k*<sub>pba</sub>), log(*k*<sub>trbb</sub>/*k*<sub>pbb</sub>), log([M]/[Ini]), log([M]).

The data are arranged in the order of the recommended reaction parameter combinations generated by the Bayesian optimization cycle.
