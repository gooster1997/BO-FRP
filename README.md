# Bayesian Optimization for Free Radical Polymerization (BO-FRP)

This is a framework for exploring the condition space of free radical polymerization (FRP) using Bayesian optimization and Monte Carlo simulation. It can be used to find optimal polymerization conditions that result in a narrow molecular weight distribution. The Bayesian optimization part of the framework is developed based on the botorch module, which can be found at https://github.com/pytorch/botorch. For more details, please see our article which is currently under submission (the link will be added later).

## Requirements
The following modules are required to run the program:
-python==3.7.0
